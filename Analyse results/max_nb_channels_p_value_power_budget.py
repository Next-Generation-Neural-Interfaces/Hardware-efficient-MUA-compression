Basically, we're checking how many channels we can have on a FPGA of a 
certain size. Some channels have higher BRs that others, and so the 
communication power, and therefore heat flux, varies. So what's the worst 
case? We find it by taking a random sample of all considered channels, taking 
the total BR, and adding the ADC and static power the comm energy per bit to
get the total power. If it exceeds the heating limit, we mark it (matrix
called "nb_channels_that_exceeded_power_budget" at the end). Each column 
in "nb_channels_that_exceeded_power_budget" corresponds to a number of 
considered channels, given in 'nb_channels_vec'. This gives a 
permutation-derived p-value as to how likely having a number of channels is 
to exceed the power budget.
