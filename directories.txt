% Directories for data, results, etc. At the beginning of eahc line is the "key", which specifies how the 
% code will search for the directory. The directory path is located to the right of the key, and is read by the Python
% scripts by finding the text between single apostrophe marks (so the directory path should be placed to the right of the key
% between apostrophe marks, e.g. [key = 'C:\bob\desired_path']).
