% Directories for data, results, etc. At the beginning of each line is the "key", which specifies how the 
% code will search for the directory. The directory path is located to the right of the key, and is read by the Python
% scripts by finding the text between single apostrophe marks (so the directory path should be placed to the right of the key
% between apostrophe marks, e.g. [key = 'C:\bob\desired_path']).

%%%% Directories %%%%

% Root directory, where this file and major sub-directories are located.
% e.g. home_directory = 'C:\User\MUA_compression_root_directory'
home_directory = ''

% SCLV path: where we store the SCLV representations of the Huffman encoders for each S. 
% Typically located in "Compressing data\Produce SCLVs" directory.
SCLV_path = 'D:\Dropbox (Imperial NGNI)\NGNI Share\Workspace\Oscar\Work\MUA compression\Upload code\Compressing data\Produce SCLVs'

% Path to BDP results
BDP_results = 'D:\Dropbox (Imperial NGNI)\NGNI Share\Workspace\Oscar\Work\MUA compression\Upload code\Results\BDP_results'

% Path to compression BR results
BR_no_sort_results = 'D:\Dropbox (Imperial NGNI)\NGNI Share\Workspace\Oscar\Work\MUA compression\Upload code\Results\BR_results_no_sort'
BR_approx_sort_results = 'D:\Dropbox (Imperial NGNI)\NGNI Share\Workspace\Oscar\Work\MUA compression\Upload code\Results\BR_results_approx_sort'


% Path to combiend results (excel spreadsheet)
combined_results_excel_path = 'D:\Dropbox (Imperial NGNI)\NGNI Share\Workspace\Oscar\Work\MUA compression\Upload code\Results'
